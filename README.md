A short shell script that returns you your IPv4 address and its geolocation.

#### Update August 1st 2020.

The file oneliner.sh is no longer supported for a variaty of reasons. findmepls.sh has been updated with the new api and is now the default script again. Some of you may have to update your alias's in your `~/.bash_profile`.

It should be `myip="/bin/bash ~/whereAmI/findmepls.sh`.

## Installation

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/trozler/whereAmI.git
```

I recommend adding the following alias to your bashprofile (`~/.bash_profile`).
`~/.bashrc` should also work.

```
$ echo -e '\nalias myip="/bin/bash ~/whereAmI/findmepls.sh"' >> ~/.bash_profile
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

## How to run

If you created the alias:

```
$ myip
88.3.356.944 - Palma, Balearic Islands, ES.
```

Otherwise:

```
$ /bin/bash ~/whereAmI/findmepls.sh
88.3.356.944 - Palma, Balearic Islands, ES.
```

### Note on usage

Lastly, if you are not connected to the internet, then well, you must be somewhere off the shoulder of Orion.
